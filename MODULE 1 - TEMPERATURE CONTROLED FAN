20EC5203  ELECTRONIC DESIGN PROJECT- I
MODULE 1 - TEMPERATURE CONTROLED FAN 

<ABSTRACT>

Improving comfort and energy efficiency is the role of a fan with temperature controlthat adjusts its speed according to room temperature, guaranteeing best flow of air aswell as less wastefulness associated with additional
power usage for cooling. The fanthat regulates temperature offers a more comfortable environment and improvedefficiency when it varies the flow of air depending on the surrounding temperatures.This technology helps to maintain 
ideal conditions in rooms, limits energy usage, andstops overheating which all result into better indoor air quality and comfort as well.Current solutions for temperature-controlled fans include thermostatic switches and smart 
fan controllers that adjust speed based on temperature. Limitations involvedelayed response to temperature changes, inconsistent performance, and potentialcompatibility issues with various fan models and systems.

<INTRODUCTION>

The Temperature-Controlled Fan Project is a practical and innovative initiative aimedat developing an intelligent cooling system that automatically adjusts its speed basedon the surrounding temperature. This project is 
designed to provide an energyefficient and user-friendly solution for maintaining comfortable indoor environmentsin various settings, such as homes, offices, and commercial spaces. By integratingtemperature sensing and 
automated control mechanisms, the system ensures optimalcooling performance while minimizing energy consumption and operational costs.The core idea behind this project is to address the limitations of traditional fans,
whichrequire manual adjustments and often operate inefficiently, leading to unnecessarypower usage. Using components such as a temperature sensor (e.g., thermistor), amicrocontroller for decision-making, and a fan with 
variable speed control, the systemcontinuously monitors ambient temperature and adjusts the fan's speed accordingly[1]. It demonstrates the application of modern technology in creating smarter appliances,aligning with
the growing demand for energy-efficient solutions in both residential and commercial domains. By successfully implementing this project, users gainvaluable insights into the principles of sensor-based systems, embedded 
programming,and energy optimization[2]. This project is not just a practical tool but a stepping stone toward building more advanced and intelligent climate control systems.
